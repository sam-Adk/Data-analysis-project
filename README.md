### Youtube  and Spotify Dataset

**code** https://github.com/sam-Adk/Data-analysis-project/blob/main/youtube%20and%20spotify%20dataset.ipynb


**Goal**  The goal of this project is to analyze how different engagement metrics‚Äîsuch as likes, comments, views (on YouTube) and popularity scores or follower counts (on Spotify)‚Äîinfluence the number of streams a song or video receives. By comparing YouTube and Spotify data, the analysis aims to uncover patterns in listener/viewer behavior and determine whether social engagement can predict streaming succes

**Description**  

-Positive Correlation Between Views and Streams: Videos with more YouTube views generally correspond to higher Spotify streaming numbers, suggesting that exposure on one platform may influence listening on another.

-Likes Matter More Than Comments: While comments are valuable for engagement, the number of likes showed a stronger relationship with total streams, indicating that positive viewer sentiment may better reflect popularity.

-Outliers Exist: Some tracks had relatively low YouTube engagement but high Spotify streams, likely due to playlist placements or artist popularity. Conversely, some viral videos did not translate to Spotify success.

-Release Timing and Genre: Songs released closer to peak streaming periods (e.g., weekends or holidays) tended to perform better. Certain genres (e.g., pop, hip-hop) showed stronger cross-platform engagement

## üìÅ Data Sources

- YouTube data scraped using [YouTube API / third-party tool]
- Spotify track and artist data obtained via Spotify Web API
- Data cleaned and merged using Python (pandas), with visualization using seaborn/matplotlib

## üîç Methods

- Correlation analysis between views, likes, comments, and Spotify streams
- Regression models to test predictive power of engagement metrics
- Outlier detection for viral content with unusual patterns











### India Census Data


**code** https://github.com/sam-Adk/Data-analysis-project/blob/main/india%20census.ipynb

**Goal** The goal of this project is to explore demographic trends in India's population using census data. This includes analyzing population growth, age distribution, rural vs urban populations, and state-wise comparisons to identify long-term patterns and regional difference

**Description** 


-Gender Ratio: Several northern states show a gender imbalance, with fewer females per 1,000 males, while some southern states have near-equal or better female-to-male ratios.

-Literacy Rates: Kerala has the highest literacy rate, while Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh have some of the lowest.

-Urbanization: States like Delhi and Maharashtra are highly urbanized, while states like Bihar and Assam remain predominantly rural.

-Workforce Participation: A significant portion of the female population is not part of the formal labor force, especially in rural region

### Adult Csv Project

**code**https://github.com/sam-Adk/Data-analysis-project/blob/main/Adult%20Csv%20project.ipynb

**Goal** determine if age gender and eduational level determine the level of income

**Description**
- involves cleaning anlyzing datasets to coming up with a conclusion
- focusing on determining what determines the level of income based on gander ,age and level of education
- found out  more male  had more chance to get more salaries above 50k than females
- also found out that some workclass were paid more than other working class
- also the income increaed with age
